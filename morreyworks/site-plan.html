        Are you looking for someone to build you a beautiful piece of furniture or create a special hand-made gift? My name is Steve Morrey and I would love to do exactly that for you! I build everything from book or display shelves, to elegant mantle clocks and jewelry boxes. Would you like a set of wooden coasters or a pen and pencil set in their own matching boxes? I can do that. All of the pieces I create can be personalized. I do resin inlays with names or pictures, and can add carved designs and borders. I am always happy to listen to your vision and to work with you to make the perfect item. I have other services available too such as some restorations or resurfacing table tops. If you have a project that you would like done, please don’t hesitate to ask me about it. All of my custom pieces can be delivered for free in the Salt Lake area, or shipped for an additional fee.

      <h3>Samples</h3>
      <p>
        Here is just a sample of some of the items that I have custom made for people. These beautiful mantle clocks play the Westminster chimes. They can have carvings added down the sides of the face as an accent. All jewelry boxes can be laid out in any way you like. Choose an inside velvet color and have a music box movement added if you want, with a variety of songs to choose from. The inside of boxes can also be left as an open space for photos or other desired uses. Coasters can be inlaid with an image of your choice. Pens come in a variety of colors, and sets can have a name added to the pens themselves, or just the outside of the box. Display shelves can be made with inside lighting. There are many different wood options to choose from also. If there is something you don’t see that you would like to have made, contact me and let’s discuss it!
